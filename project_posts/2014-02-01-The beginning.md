Ok let`s start diving in the world of rythms and groove.

At first let me tell you how the idea was born and how it grew up.

Have you ever noticed yourself drumming some rythm with your fingers? I am sure you have. Because music is everywhere around us: on tv, in the streets, in iternet. And when you hear nice groove you can not resist it. So one day I thought: what if I could drum with fingers like on real drumm set.
I discussed the idea fith friends and we thought that we need some kind of sensors to detect the knock and some device to play the sound. We thought that it will be cool to keep hand free of wires to playing-sound-device. 
So that was the concept (and it is still alive): 

`sensor - processing board - wireless connection channel - playing device`

So let`s how it looked like in version 1. 

This is v.1 processing board

Not very tasty, is it :) It was custom hand made board with a lot of nasty soldering. 
But it worked nice. We wrote a lot of c++ code to send data on windows based desktop and play sound. Little bit gigantic clumsy thing.
